  → Ready to implement determinant from scratch tomorrow
- [x] **Structure**  
  → Created folders: `daily-logs/`, `math-foundations/`, `python-basics/`

## Time Spent
⏱️ ~1.5 hours pure focus (exhausted but no zero day)  
📍 Tehran, Iran

> Day 8 – First time a serious math topic truly clicked.  
> Tomorrow I code determinant myself.  
> Chain is now **8 days strong and unbreakable**.  
> From Tehran to MIT – no zero days, no excuses.
