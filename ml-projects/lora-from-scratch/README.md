# LoRA from Scratch (Coming March 2026)

My first flagship PEFT project.

### What this will include
- Full LoRA implementation from scratch (no PEFT library at first)
- Fine-tuning LLaMA-3-8B with LoRA
- Memory/speed/accuracy comparison vs full fine-tuning
- Training & inference scripts
- Gradio demo + Google Colab notebook

Status: Planned (starting after foundations phase)
